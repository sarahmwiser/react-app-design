## Other Build Tools  

Create React App is not the only build tool you can use to scaffold a React project.

Other tools such as <a href="https://vitejs.dev/">Vite</a> and <a href="https://parceljs.org/">Parcel</a> can scaffold your React with a faster (currently) build process. Vite has pre-packed templates for a complete React project while Parcel (currently)
needs a manual installation of the ```react``` and ```react-dom``` packages and creation of a few files to get going.

### What is a Bundler?

A bundler is a development tool that will compress and minify all your code. And if you have a function that is never used, it will detect that and remove that. A bundler generates a dependency graph as it traverses your first code files. This implies that beginning with the entry point you specified, the module bundler keeps track of both your source filesâ€™ dependencies and third-party dependencies. This dependency graph guarantees that all source and associated code files are kept up to date and error-free.

The bundler tool that is included within the Create React App tool is ```Webpack```. Webpack is the most popular bundler tool by a large margin, but that does not mean it does not have its problems. 

Webpack can be confusing to configure manually; can be slow to start up its development server because it has to bundle all files in node_modules; bundle sizes can be large because it required polyfills for loading modules.

But never fear, there are alternatives.

### Parcel

<a href="https://parceljs.org/docs/">Parcel</a> is marketed a "zero-configuration" build tool.

Not only does it do the ```bundling``` of all of your project files (.js, .css, etc) no matter what framework you are using (React, Vue, etc) it will determine the necessary plugins and dev dependencies automatically (the ```build``` part).

Includes out of the box:

 - <a href="https://parceljs.org/features/development/#dev-server">Dev server</a>
 - <a href="https://swc.rs/">SWC</a> (transpiling - faster than Babel, built with Rust)
 - <a href="https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel-css">Parcel CSS</a> - CSS parser, compiler and minifier (also built with Rust)

 ```Setup for React```

Parcel apps start with an HTML file. Parcel follows the dependencies from there to build your app. Look at the <a href="https://parceljs.org/recipes/react/">documentation</a> for complete code setup.

 - npm i -D parcel (dev dependency)
 - npm i react react-dom
 - creat an index.html in src folder
 - create an index.js in src folder
 - setup dev script (package.json): ```"dev": "parcel src/index.html --open"```
 - open browser to https://localhost:1234

### Vite (pronounced "veet")

<a href="https://vitejs.dev/guide/">Vite</a> is another build tool that handles everything you need to setup a front-end project.

Vite has a build setup templates (with TypeScript) for:

- React
- Preact
- Svelte
- Vue
- Vanilla JS

So you don't have to install anything else manually.

 ```Setup for React```

 - type ```npm create vite@latest```
 - follow prompts to install React build setup

You can try it out on <a href="https://vitejs.dev/guide/#trying-vite-online">StackBlitz</a> for yourself.
